Instruction:
       
        TCG mode times #_of_hillclimb ratio

        mode <a, w, s>:
       
              a: area optimization alone
        
              w: wirelength optimization alone

              s: simulatenou area and wirelength 

        times: 
    
             In each iteration, TCG runs 
             
             times X (number of modules) 

             times


       #_of_hillclimb:

            Before apply simulate annealing algorithm,
            
            we first run hill climb algorithm  

            #_of_hillclimb times. The temperature
  
            will keep in T=1.

      ratio:

           The parameter will significantly affect the 
      
           converge rate of TCG. If you set the value too small, 

           the program will converge slowly. However, if

           you set the value too large, the program may stop quickly

           before reaching a good solution.


    For example,

         TCG  ami33 a 10 3 800  

     
Compile:

     To compile the program, you need to have "LEDA package"

     on the Sun Ultra workstation. The LEDA package is available

     from http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/LEDA.
    
 
=================================================================   
Note that in this program, the method to find reduction edges
  
is different from that written in our paper because this program

is the old version. 

=================================================================
show.cc is used to show the graph from the output file.

    For example,

          show  *.out
